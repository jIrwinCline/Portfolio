        <h2>A little about me:</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>My name is Jacob Irwin-Cline. I began my professional career with high-intensity blue collar jobs such as roofing and general construction in central Oregon, USA. After learning essential team management skills and becoming an effective foreman for my crew in less than 6 months, I began shifting my focus towards formal education. My goal was to learn how to operate my own business with effective big-picture goals. <br>

        I relocated near my preffered school, earned my first transfer degree, and ulimately attended Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. During this time, I handled a career in private security for a premier full-service security and investigations company, Corpoarate Crime Control Association. I rapidly demonstrated potential in this industry as well, and after a year of service, I was personally handling multiple teams and client contracts in a project management role. <br>

        During my employment and schooling I developed an interest in tech. What started off as an interest soon turned into a deep held passion and I began teaching myself programmining languages such as <span class="style1">JavaScript, Ruby, and R.</span> I'm currently developing and refining these skill constantly, with eyes set on renowned vocational schools to take my expertise to the next level. As far as my formal education in business, By June 15th of 2019, I was walking with 2 degrees in specialized business knowledge: Management and Leadership, and Human Resource Management. The combination of my knowledge, skills, abilities and continuing experience speaks for itself in the market of people.</p>
